Project 1 - Expert Systems for Reasource Allocation

This program can be ran using CLIPS.

CLIPS> (batch run.bat)

This run.bat takes in a file named "input.txt". I have discarded my test file
as requested in the project description.

The call above will run the program initiating all rules, globals, functions,
and facts needed to complete the process.

Two output files will be produced. One with comments on everything being ran
and the other with only the phase changes.
